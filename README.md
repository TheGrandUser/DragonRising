DragonRising
============

A roguelike where you are the dragon

Written in C# 6 making use of all the fun new features. 

Also a lot of use of async/await, particularly for getting player input and managing game state/screens.

It's currently little more than the what the [complete tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod) on roguebasin is, as I'm building my engine to support those steps, but obviously in a modern .NET style rather than the simple pyhton style it uses.
